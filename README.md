# HighCardGame
This is a Team project consisting of me and two of my teammates, Samarth Patel and Kethan Gubbala. This Java project is a simple card game designed for two players. Each player enters their name and initial funds through a graphical user interface (GUI), and the game proceeds in rounds where players bet, draw cards, and compete to see who draws the higher card. The player with the higher card wins the round and the pot. The game continues until one player runs out of money or chooses to quit. The project leverages Java Swing for the GUI, providing an interactive experience, and it encapsulates key object-oriented programming principles such as inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism. This setup not only makes it educational but also fun and engaging for users.
